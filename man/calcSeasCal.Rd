\description{
This function estimates the rainy season calendar, i.e onset date, cessation date and duration of the rainy season
based on Agroclimatic approach. The agroclimatic approach defines the onset of the rainy season as the optimal date that
ensures sufficient soil moisture during planting and early growing periods to avoid crop failure after sowing and requires
information on rainfall, reference evapotranspiration and accounting of the daily soil water balance parameters.
}
\details{
As per agroclimatic approach, a normal rainy season (growing season) is defined as one when there is an excess of precipitation
over potential evapotranspiration (PET). Such a period met the evapotransiration demands of crops and recharge the moisture
of the soil profile (FAO 1977; 1978; 1986). Thus, the rainy season calendar defined accordingly:

\strong{Onset}

The \emph{onset} of the rainy season will start on the first day after \emph{onsetWind.start}, when the actual-to-potential
evapotranspiration ratio is greater than 0.5 for 7 consecutive days, followed by a 20-day period in which plant available
water remains above wilting over the root zone of the soil layer.

\strong{Cesation}

The rainy season will end, \emph{cessation}, on the first day after \emph{onsetWind.end}, when the actual-to-potential
evapotranspiration ratio is less than 0.5 for 7 consecutive days, followed by 12 consecutive non-growing days in which plant
available water remains below wilting over the root zone of the soil layer.

\strong{Duration}

The \emph{duration} of the rainy season is the total number of days from onset to cessation of the season.

# load example data:
data(AgroClimateData)

# Estimate daily PET:
PET <- calcEto(AgroClimateData, method = "PM", crop = "short")

# Add the estimated PET 'ET.Daily' to a new column in AgroClimateData:
AgroClimateData$Eto <- PET$ET.Daily

# Estimate daily water balance for the soil having 100mm of WHC:
watBal <- calcWatBal(AgroClimateData, soilWHC = 100)

# estimate the rainy season calandar (Onset, Cessation and Duration):
onsetWind.start = "1996-09-01"  # earliest possible start data of the onset window
onsetWind.end = "1997-01-31"   # the late possible date for end of the onset window
cessaWind.end = "1997-06-30"   # the late possible date for end of the cessation window
