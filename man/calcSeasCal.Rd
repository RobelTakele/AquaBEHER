\value{
The function generates a data frame containing the following components:

\emph{\code{Year: year of the rainy season in "YYYY".}}

\emph{\code{Onset.DOY: onset date of the rainy season in julian day.}}

\emph{\code{Cesation.DOY: cessation date of the rainy season in julian day.}}

\emph{\code{SeasDur: durtion of the season in days.}}
}
\description{
This function estimates the rainy season calendar, i.e onset date, cessation data and duration of the rainy season based on
Agroclimatic approach. The agroclimatic approach defines the onset of the rainy season as the optimal date that ensures sufficient soil moisture
during planting and early growing periods to avoid crop failure after sowing and requires information on rainfall and temperature as well as
the soil water balance at daily time scale.
}
\details{
As per agroclimatic approach, a normal rainy season (growing season) is defined as one when there is an excess of precipitation over
potential evapotranspiration (PET). Such a period meets the evapotransiration demands of crops and recharge the moisture of the soil profile
(FAO 1977; 1978; 1986). Thus, the rainy season calendar defined accordingly:

\strong{Onset}

The \emph{onset} of the rainy season will start on the first day after \emph{onsetWind.start}, when the actual-to-potential evapotranspiration
ratio \emph{(e_thresh)} is greater than 0.25 and is followed by a 20-day period in which plant available water \emph{(AW_thr)} remains above 10mm.

\strong{Cesation}

The rainy season will end, \emph{cessation}, on the first day after \emph{onsetWind.end}, when the actual-to-potential evapotranspiration ratio
\emph{(e_thresh)} is less than or equal to 0.25 and followed 12 consecutive non-growing days \emph{(AW_thr <= 10mm)}.

\strong{Duration}

The \emph{duration} of the rainy season is taken as the difference between the Julian day numbers of the determined cessation date and the
determined onset date for that season, i.e. the number of days from onset to cessation.

# load example data:
data(climateData)

# Estimate daily PET:
PET <- calcEto(AgroClimateData, method = "PM", crop = "short")

# Add the estimated PET 'ET.Daily' to a new column in AgroClimateData:
AgroClimateData$Eto <- PET$ET.Daily

# Estimate daily water balance for the soil having 100mm of WHC:
watBal<- calcWatBal(AgroClimateData, soilWHC = 100)

# estimate the rainy season calandar (Onset, Cessation and Duration):
onsetWind.start = "2019-09-01"  # earliest possible start data of the onset window
onsetWind.end = "2020-01-31"   # the late possible date for end of the onset window
