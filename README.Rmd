# AquaBEHER

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

 The goal of AquaBEHER is to computes and integrates daily reference evapotranspiration (Eto) into FAO56 water balance model. 
 The AquaBEHER package can estimate daily parameters of crop and soil water balances parameters for agricultural crops. The package can also 
    estimate rainy season calandar (Onset, Cessation and Duration) based on agroclimatic approach. 

Specifically, the package can perform the following functions:

+   Estimation of daily evapotranspiration
+   Estimation of daily soil water balance
+   Estimation of rainy season calandar:
    +   Onset of the rainy season
    +   Cessation of the rainy season
    +   Duration of the rainy season

## Installation

You can install the development version of AquaBEHER from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RobelTakele/AquaBEHER")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to estimate daily water balance:

```{r example}
library(AquaBEHER)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r climateData}
data(climateData)

head(climateData)
 
```

```{r watBal.daily}

Eto.daily <- calcEto(climateData)
climateData$Eto <- Eto.daily$ET.Daily
soilWHC = 100
watBal.daily <- calcWatBal(climateData, soilWHC)

```

The output of daily soil water balance can be ploted:

```{r }

plot(watBal.daily$ERATIO*100, ty="l")
lines(watBal.daily$Eto, col="red")
lines(watBal.daily$Rain, col="blue")
```
